We created a game based on Super Mario Bros, but we replaced all the characters with people from the Binghamton CS Department. When you open the app, you are on the main screen where you can choose to view the instructions or the leaderboard, or start playing the game. If you click to start playing the game, you are taken to a screen to customize your character. If you choose to customize the character, your camera opens and you can take a photo of your face to put on the character. 

Then you will play the actual game. It has three levels. Each level increases in difficulty, specifically by the types of enemies included. The first level has regular enemies that just walk towards you. These are represented by Professor Madden and Professor Moore. The second level has the same enemies in addition to enemies who fly. These are represented by Professor Head and Professor Lander. In the last level we include enemies who act like Thwomps (an enemy in Mario). These are represented by Professor Weinschenk and Professor Umrigar.

You can move in the game by tapping on the screen in the direction you want to move. You want to move for a few reasons. First, you can either avoid or kill enemies. If you jump on the enemies, that kills them. Second, you can move to avoid obstacles. If you run into an obstacle, nothing bad happens unless you donâ€™t move. Then you might get pushed off the screen and die. Third, you want to move to collect collectibles, which are represented by the StackOverflow logo. For every collectible you grab, your score is increased by 50 points at the end of the level. Fourth, you can move to get power up items. These are hidden in boxes with a ?. If you jump under the question mark box, a power up item will appear on top, then you can collect it to get a time limited special ability. These include immunity (A+ paper) or speed boost (coffee cup).

If you complete the game, Harvey Stenger hands you your diploma. Additionally, if your score is in the top 10 highscores, then you can add your name to the leaderboard.
